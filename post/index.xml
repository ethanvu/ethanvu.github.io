      <description>A couple of months ago, I bought a mechanical keyboard for $150 and a coworker was surprised when I told him. He asked why I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get an office keyboard for a tenth of the price. Clearly he&amp;rsquo;s never beaten Cook, Serve, Delicious! on extreme difficulty or else he would know.
For each tug at a wine&amp;rsquo;s cork, each pounding of a tenderizer onto a chicken breast, each ingredient added to a salad bowl, there is visceral feedback, both audio and touch.</description>

      <description>Here I&amp;rsquo;ll describe the buckets that I put games into for how much I enjoyed them.
There are eight in total, numbered 0 to 7, which is unconventional, but I feel that is just the optimal number of buckets. Most video game reviewers that apply ratings to the games usually use a 10-point scale but don&amp;rsquo;t utilize the lower end anyway.
0 These are worst games of all time. They are unique in how offensively bad they are.</description>
