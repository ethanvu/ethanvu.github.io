          <p>A couple of months ago, I bought a mechanical keyboard for $150 and a coworker was surprised when I told him.  He asked why I wouldn&rsquo;t get an office keyboard for a tenth of the price.  Clearly he&rsquo;s never beaten <em>Cook, Serve, Delicious!</em> on extreme difficulty or else he would know.</p>
<p>For each tug at a wine&rsquo;s cork, each pounding of a tenderizer onto a chicken breast, each ingredient added to a salad bowl, there is visceral feedback, both audio and touch.  The superb audio feedback is due to the crisp sound design of the video game.  But the touch feedback is from the strokes of the keyboard; it&rsquo;s external.  To experience <em>Cook, Serve, Delicious!</em> at it&rsquo;s fullest, a mechanical keyboard is highly recommended.  Because it&rsquo;s not so much a cooking simulation as it is a stenographer at a courtroom for zoo animals simulation.</p>
<p>The core gameplay loop is simple.  Before each day, the player character, a cook and restaurateur, will choose what dishes they will serve to the denizens of SherriSoda Tower.  During the day, the cook will juggle assembling and not overcooking orders with chores such as taking out the trash and flushing toilets (yes, the person cleaning the toilets is also preparing the meals) over five phases: morning, lunch rush hour, afternoon, dinner rush hour, and night.  The rush hour phases are regular phases turned up to 10 (or 11 if playing on extreme mode).  At the end of the day, a report card showing many perfect, okay, and bad orders there were, the longest streak of perfect orders, etc.  Then the day begins anew.  It&rsquo;s repetitive, but David Galindo, the game director, tries to spice it up in several ways.</p>
<p>Folks, such as Crazy Dave, the CookBets robot, local celebrities, Cook4Luv dates will challenge the player character to cook different dishes for rewards such as money, buzz for the next day (to increase the number of customers to get money to buy upgrades), and golden tickets (to beat the Hungry Festivities).  Food rot, which affects most dishes, encourages the cook to devise different menus lest they suffer a buzz penalty.  There are also catering events, Iron Cook studio, and Hungry Festivities that need to be completed in order to achieve a platinum star restaurant.</p>
<p>The difficulty progression mostly comes from the buying of recipe upgrades and new foods to serve, which is another requirement to get a platinum star restaurant.  As recipes are upgraded, the player will have to remember more and more mappings from ingredient to keyboard key.  Eventually, there will be collisions.</p>
<p>For example, when soup is first bought, there are two ingredients that start with &ldquo;B&rdquo;: bowtie noodles and bouillon cubes.  Bacon, beans, and broccoli are introduced at levels three, four, and five respectively.  By default, bowtie noodles map to W, bullion cubes to U, bacon to B, beans to E, and broccoli to R.</p>
<p>As newer dishes are acquired, the more complicated they tend to be.  One of the first dishes the player character will likely purchase is the pretzel which require one of two toppings or no toppings at all.  In contrast, shish kabobs, one of the last dishes to be acquired, requires eight units of food and there are 10 ingredients to choose from.  However, two food units of the same ingredient cannot be adjacent to one another.  This adds another dimension of consideration for the cook.  It&rsquo;s not enough to get the combination right, but the permutation as well.</p>
<p>The pursuit of translating of orders into keystrokes without any mistakes, a perfect day, is what makes <em>Cook, Serve, Delicious!</em> challenging and fun.  Ultimately, the game is a couple steps above restaurant sims that could be found on Miniclip.  There is a clear difference between a good and bad cooker, server, and delicious-er!, but it might not be worth it to get good.  It won&rsquo;t be &ldquo;weighty&rdquo; enough for some to sink more than 10 hours into it.  It was for me though.</p>
