          <p>In typical <em>Call of Duty</em> multiplayer modes, kills and deaths are meaningless.  Respawn timers are as fast as one is able to hit the F key and scoreboards hide death counters until the end of matches.  The game is so fast paced, there’s not much time for long term planning.  It’s not like most folks have a plan anyway.  I have a 1.33 win/loss ratio despite a 0.99 kill/death ratio simply because I’m the only player haphazardly throwing my body onto objectives.  As a battle royale game, <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em> is different from the typical <em>CoD</em> formula.  But as a <em>Call of Duty</em> game, it still retains its trademark game flow (and assorted bullshit).</p>
<p>Like many games in the battle royale genre, <em>Warzone</em> has a big map, looting, and high penalties for dying (i.e. all equipment is lost when killed).  These attributes incentivizes players to slowplay.  “Slowplay” is not part of the <em>Call of Duty</em> ethos, something Infinity Ward, the studio that has shepherded the series through the past 17 years, knows very well.</p>
<p>What makes <em>Warzone</em> most distinct from its peers are contracts, custom loadouts, and respawn opportunities.  Contracts encourage teams to move around the city of Verdansk and complete objectives for money and rewards.  For example, bounties task teams to track down and assassinate players on other teams.</p>
<p>Money earned upon completion of contracts can be used to buy equipment such as gas masks, air strikes, and loadout drops.  Loadout drops are the most interesting part of the game in my opinion.  Players can choose any loadout (i.e. weapons, attachments, equipment, and perks) that they’ve put together before queuing into the match.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODWarzone/comments/ipayee/we_need_a_loadoutless_br_mode/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link">Some folks</a> don’t prefer the de-emphasis on looting, but I quite like that players can play how they want to play.  For example, I enjoy sniping so my go-to loadout is an HDR primary.  I also use Overkill as my red perk so I can use an M4 as a secondary for close-to-mid range fights.  My friend uses a heartbeat sensor for his tactical equipment, but I take stun grenades so I can play aggressive when I feel like I need to.</p>
<p>Money can also be used to bring back fallen teammates.  The worst thing about playing on a team in a battle royale game is when a player dies and has to wait for their teammate to get killed or win the game.  In either case, the dead player will have to wait upwards of 30 minutes.  Other opportunities to come back into the game are winning an at-most-once-per-game gulag match or a random once-per-50ish-games prison break.</p>
<p>Because of this the flow of a match much more resembles a healthy marriage between battle royale games and <em>CoD</em> games.  As with all marriages, there are some problems.  Sometimes, there is an overcentralization in the weapon meta such as the Bruen in season 4.  <a href="https://v.redd.it/lrpljo01tvl51">Vehicles rolling at 1 km/hr can kill for some reason</a>.  Car chases are surprisingly tame because ramming other cars is relatively ineffective.  There are technical problems like <a href="https://youtu.be/rf3KlmfgRRQ">weapon model glitches</a> (fixed as of writing) and aim/wall hackers (still not fixed).  Still, there aren’t many feelings more rewarding than winning a <em>Warzone</em> match and seeing the names of the 140+ people that have been bested.</p>
