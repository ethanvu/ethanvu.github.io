      <description>In typical Call of Duty multiplayer, dying is meaningless. Respawn timers are as fast as one can hit F on the keyboard and scoreboards hide death counters until the end of matches. The game is so fast paced that there’s no time for long term planning. It’s not like most folks have a plan anyway. During free weekends of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019), I accrued a 57% win rate despite only killing 0.</description>

      <title>Mass Effect (2007) Review</title>

      <description>One of the most harrowing thoughts is that we humans might be all alone in the Universe. When the Sun inevitably devours Earth, will there be no one left to experience the world and create stories? BioWare imagines a galaxy where the answer is NO in Mass Effect. This galaxy is buzzing with life and adventure. It’s rife with conflict and problems, but they’re not unsolvable. In fact, they’re waiting to be solved… by the right person.</description>

      <title>Polygoneer (2017) Review</title>

      <description>Playing Polygoneer vaguely reminds me of John Wick fighting Iosef and his guards in the nightclub from his namesake 2014 film: bad guys from all sides getting shot while pretty shapes and colorful colors dance to bumpin’ music in the background. Polygoneer lacks the excitement and intensity that John Wick has however.
The principal reasons for this are that beating stages is extremely easy and the difficulty in each stage never ramps up.</description>

      <title>Installing ALOT, ALOV, MEUITM, and other mods for Mass Effect on Linux</title>

      <description>Introduction Valve&amp;rsquo;s Proton allows Steam users to run games that don&amp;rsquo;t have a native Linux implementation on their Linux machines. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing. Mass Effect is has a Gold rating on ProtonDB which means it runs well when using Proton, with minor adjustments. If you have the game on Origin or you have a physical copy, you can also play on Linux, but you&amp;rsquo;ll have to use Lutris or something similar instead.</description>

      <title>Cook, Serve, Delicious! (2012) Review</title>

      <description>I once dropped $400 on parts to build a mechanical keyboard. A coworker was surprised when he found out how much I’ve spent. He asked why I wouldn’t get an office keyboard for a tenth of the price. Clearly he’s never beaten Cook, Serve, Delicious! on extreme difficulty or else he would know.
What he would know is the satisfaction of seeing an order for a Manhattan salad and instinctively typing “rcbomg” on the keyboard in a fluid motion or seeing an order for a classic Italian lasagna and typing “pscr” three times fast.</description>
