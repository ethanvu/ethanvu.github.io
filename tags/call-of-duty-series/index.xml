      <description>In typical Call of Duty multiplayer modes, kills and deaths are meaningless. Respawn timers are as fast as one is able to hit the F key and scoreboards hide death counters until the end of matches. The game is so fast paced, there’s not much time for long term planning. It’s not like most folks have a plan anyway. I have a 1.33 win/loss ratio despite a 0.99 kill/death ratio simply because I’m the only player haphazardly throwing my body onto objectives.</description>
