      <description>Imagine if your abusive ex-boyfriend broke into your home while you were there. Or if you accidentally amputated your leg with a buzzsaw.

In career mode, players experience a month as the titular 911 operator in any city of their choosing (I&amp;rsquo;m not exaggerating when I say any).</description>
