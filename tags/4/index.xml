      <description>In typical Call of Duty multiplayer, dying is meaningless. Respawn timers are as fast as one can hit F on the keyboard and scoreboards hide death counters until the end of matches. The game is so fast paced that there’s no time for long term planning. It’s not like most folks have a plan anyway. During free weekends of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019), I accrued a 57% win rate despite only killing 0.</description>

      <description>I once dropped $400 on parts to build a mechanical keyboard. A coworker was surprised when he found out how much I’ve spent. He asked why I wouldn’t get an office keyboard for a tenth of the price. Clearly he’s never beaten Cook, Serve, Delicious! on extreme difficulty or else he would know.
What he would know is the satisfaction of seeing an order for a Manhattan salad and instinctively typing “rcbomg” on the keyboard in a fluid motion or seeing an order for a classic Italian lasagna and typing “pscr” three times fast.</description>
