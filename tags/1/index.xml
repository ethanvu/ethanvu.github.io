      <description>One of the most harrowing thoughts is that we humans might be all alone in the Universe. When the Sun inevitably devours Earth, will there be no one left to experience the world and create stories? BioWare imagines a galaxy where the answer is NO in Mass Effect. This galaxy is buzzing with life and adventure. It’s rife with conflict and problems, but they’re not unsolvable. In fact, they’re waiting to be solved… by the right person.</description>

      <title>Polygoneer (2017) Review</title>

      <description>Playing Polygoneer makes me think of John Wick hunting the Russian kid in the nightclub from the first film. Shooting at bad guys coming from all sides with pretty shapes, colors, and a bumpin’ soundtrack in the background. Polygoneer lacks the excitement that John Wick (2014) has however.
Unlocking stages is extremely easy. There are world leaderboards for each level, but they don’t get harder the longer one survives. At least I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to see if they did get any more difficult because I typically end my runs after 90-ish seconds due to the monotony.</description>
