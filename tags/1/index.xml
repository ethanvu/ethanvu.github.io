      <description>Playing Polygoneer vaguely reminds me of John Wick fighting Iosef and his guards in the nightclub from his namesake 2014 film: bad guys from all sides getting shot while pretty shapes and colorful colors dance to bumpin’ music in the background. Polygoneer lacks the excitement and intensity that John Wick has however.
The principal reasons for this are that beating stages is extremely easy and the difficulty in each stage never ramps up.</description>
