				<h1>About This Website</h1>
				<p>This website was designed and coded by Ethan Vu.  All pictures 
				were also taken by him except for the circular picture on the home 
				page.  That's a shot of myself giving my sister a piggyback ride 
				many years ago taken by a friend.</p>
				<p>I created this website with 2 goals in mind.</p>
				<p>The first was to practice my coding skills, specifically in 
				HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  Because of this, I really wanted to add
				in a lot of fancy stuff like the transitioning backgrounds on the 
				home page and my flying resume on the about me page.</p>
				<p>The second was to practice my articulation skills.  90% of being
				smart is getting the point across clearly and interestingly.  
				Thinking back, I've told about 3 good stories in my entire life.  
				Every other story I tell has me stuttering and digging for the 
				right words.  This website will give me a platform to practice 
				writing skills.</p>
				<p>A person writes his best when he writes about things that he is 
				passionate about.  So I'll be talking about video games and 
				baseball.</p>
				<p>ethanvu.github.io  will essentially be my personal blog.  At least 
				for now.  I have some other ideas that I could use my website 
				for.</p>
				<p>By the way, the background image for this page is a shot I took of
				Jupiter, the Moon, and the ISS on April 18, 2016 @ 8:31 PM EST over 
				Blacksburg, VA.  I call this work of art, "Space Triangle".  It's low 
				res because it's a screen shot of a higher res video that I took of the 
				event, but I love this picture too much to not use it.</p>

				Triangle" in its full glory.</p> </div>
